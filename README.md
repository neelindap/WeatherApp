# WeatherApp

A basic weather application built using Ionic3 framework. Ionic3 internally uses Angular4, which is written in TypeScript. Using Apache Cordova, the application can used to generate installation files for native application, for both Android and iOS devices.
The application uses Wunderground's weather API(https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/), to fetch weather conditions for user's location. User can either use the phone's GPS or manually enter the city name to get the weather conditions.
The previously used location is stored in the devices local storage and used when the application is started the next time.
